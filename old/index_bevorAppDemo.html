                <!-- So in order to make it easier to read and have comments only about a sertant topic in that commit i will delete every comment after commiting and only leave the code -->
                <!-- With that when looking at a commit you can easaly read the changes and their functions directly in the code without having to look over 10 rows of comments -->
                <!-- and just in case i will keep the previous version and comments as a back up so i can look at the previous comments should i forget something  -->
